        <h1>Analog Signal Processing: Pulse Oximetry</h1>
        <p><strong>Project Focus:</strong> Reducing noise in pulse oximetry signals to improve SpO₂ measurement accuracy.</p>

        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <section class="project-overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of Pulse Oximetery was to develop a cost-effective, analog signal processing circuit that reduces noise in pulse oximeter signals 
                while preserving critical physiological data. Starting from a basic pulse oximeter design using a red LED and a photoresistor to capture raw data, 
                I focused on mitigating common noise sources—such as motion artifacts, ambient light, and electronic interference—without filtering out biologically significant changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                To achieve this, I designed and simulated a second-order low-pass filter using inexpensive RC components and operational amplifiers in LTspice. 
                This analog approach allowed for effective attenuation of high-frequency noise while maintaining the integrity of the low-frequency heartbeat. 
                The iterative process—balancing performance with component cost—resulted in a circuit that reliably amplifies the desired signal within the constraints of a tight budget.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, this project showcases my expertise in analog circuit design and biomedical signal processing, 
                demonstrating how a carefully engineered analog filter can improve the accuracy of non-invasive blood oxygen monitoring.

        <!-- Understanding the Noise Problem -->
        <section class="noise-problem">
            <h2>Understanding the Noise Problem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motion Artifacts:</strong> Sudden hand movements can distort SpO₂ readings.</li>
                <li><strong>Ambient Light Interference:</strong> External light sources can introduce unwanted variations in signal detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Electronic Noise:</strong> Internal circuit noise can create fluctuations in sensor output.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These noise sources often lead to incorrect oxygen saturation readings, affecting the reliability of pulse oximeters.</p>

        <!-- Engineering Approach -->
        <section class="Design">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                To combat noise, I employed hardware filtering combining passive and active circuits to refine pulse oximeter output.
            </p>
            <h3>Hardware-Based Passive Filtering</h3>
            <p>Implemented two low-pass RC filters forming a second order filter to attenuate high-frequency noise while preserving key pulse data.</p>
            <h3>Hardware-Based Active Amplification</h3>
            <p>Implemented two non-inverting operational amplifiers to increase signal strength from milivolts up to volts, and to maintain a max and min of +/- 10V.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="testing-results">
            <h2>Testing & Results</h2>
            <p>
                To validate the effectiveness of my filtering approach, I processed real and simulated pulse oximeter signals.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Filtered signals showed a clearer heart rate waveform with improved SpO₂ accuracy.</li>
                <li>FFT analysis demonstrated reduced high-frequency noise components.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The improvements were visualized through before-and-after plots, highlighting enhanced signal clarity.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This project successfully demonstrated that noise filtration techniques can significantly enhance pulse oximeter accuracy. 
                By applying a combination of hardware and digital signal processing methods, I improved signal quality, making SpO₂ 
                measurements more reliable. Future iterations could integrate advanced filtering algorithms and machine learning models 
                to further refine real-time noise reduction.
