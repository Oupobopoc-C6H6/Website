      <h1>Personal Background</h1>
      <p>From the very start, biomedical engineering has played a pivotal role in my life.
        I was diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) before birth, which led to me becoming one of the early recipients of a fetal valvuloplasty.
         Later in life, due to aortic valve damage and stenosis, I underwent an aortic valve replacement with an On-X mechanical valve.</p>
      <p>Living with this technology firsthand has given me a unique perspective on medical devices, not just as a patient but as an aspiring engineer.</p>

      <h1>Academic Journey & Career Goals</h1>
      <p>I am currently a junior in the Biomedical Engineering department at University of South Florida, where I am actively building my expertise in electronics, biomedical instrumentation, and signal processing. My strong suits lie in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Circuit design & embedded systems – Applying electronics in biomedical applications.</li>
        <li>Digital signal processing – Filtering and analyzing physiological signals.</li>
        <li>Medical technology & device development – Understanding how engineering meets patient needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Looking ahead, I plan to continue my studies through the master’s program to further specialize in biomedical instrumentation and medical device innovation. My goal is to design and optimize medical technologies that enhance patient outcomes—just as these technologies have impacted my own life.</p>
